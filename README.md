# Bilt√§vlingen OR Car Race
This project has been created for understanding of deep logic and the combination of math. Also giving instruction list of TODO list. I have choosen four cars like:- Lamborghini, Rolls Royce, Porsche 911 and Ferrari. Those car will race between each other. Project requirment was NO GRAPHICS and NO ACCELERATOR only code, logic and combination of SimpleMath. Every car will Race 120/h and will finiched 10 KM.

Each car will have to passed few EVENT which is IMPACT by RANDOM NUMBER. 

## EVENTS are belows:
|   Event     |   Probability    |Effect|
|-----|--------|-------|
|Out of gas |   1/50   | Needs to refuel, stops 30 seconds
|Puncture |   2/50   | Needs tire change, stops 20 seconds
|Bird on the windshield |  5/50   |  Need to wash windshield, stops 10 seconds
|Engine failure |    10/50     |  The speed of the car is reduced by 1km/h

## Technologies Used
{ get; set; }, List, Async & Task, Random
